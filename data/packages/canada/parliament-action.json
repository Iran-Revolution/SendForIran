    "body": "Dear Committee Members,\n\nAs a Canadian, I am writing to request urgent parliamentary action regarding the human rights crisis in Iran.\n\nSince December 28, 2025:\n• Over 51 peaceful protesters have been killed by Iranian security forces\n• More than 2,270 people have been arbitrarily detained\n• A nationwide internet blackout has been imposed\n• Documented use of live ammunition against civilians\n\nCanada is home to one of the world's largest Iranian diaspora communities. Many Canadian families have loved ones in Iran who are at risk. I respectfully request that Parliament:\n\n1. Hold emergency hearings on the situation in Iran\n2. Apply Canada's Justice for Victims of Corrupt Foreign Officials Act (Magnitsky Act) to sanction officials responsible for human rights abuses\n3. Call for the immediate release of detained protesters\n4. Coordinate with allies on a unified international response\n5. Support technology initiatives to restore internet access in Iran\n\nCanada has a proud tradition of standing up for human rights. I urge you to act now on behalf of the Iranian people and the many Canadians with family ties to Iran.\n\nRespectfully,\nA concerned Canadian"
