Many Canadian families are directly affected by these events and are desperate for news about loved ones. Your coverage can:\n\n1. Keep the Canadian-Iranian community informed\n2. Document human rights violations\n3. Support calls for Canadian government action\n4. Maintain international attention on the crisis\n\nI respectfully request that you dedicate resources to covering this developing situation.\n\nWith sincere appreciation,\nA concerned citizen from {{senderCountry}}",
