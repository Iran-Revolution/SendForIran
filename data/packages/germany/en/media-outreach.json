Your coverage can:\n\n1. Inform Iranians about what is happening in other cities\n2. Document human rights violations for the international record\n3. Give voice to protesters and their families\n4. Keep international attention on the crisis\n\nI kindly request that you continue and expand coverage of this developing situation.\n\nWith sincere thanks,\nA concerned citizen from {{senderCountry}}",
